Clean and preprocess the data, Plot temperature over time, Create a histogram of temperature distribution, Plot a scatter plot of temperature vs. humidity and Generate a  correlation heatmap of the dataset and explain the output in a markdown cell.  
Problem 2: Implement the Chess Logic Using python, Create a GUI and Document Every Stepmaking it easy to understand and highlight any additional features implemented.  
problem 3: Create a Machine Learning Model to predict the weather
conditions, Using the weather dataset and Copy some questions in a markdown cell and answer it below
the code.

>**Bonus**: In problem2: Document your code using readme file (.md), Flip the board for each playerâ€™s turn and Convert the game to a single-player mode.
