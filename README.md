# Task 7 repo

- This repository shows all of my work during the MIA training's first phase

- Every task of the previous tasks will have its own branch of this repo

### Each task info file was made in it's own branch and then after finishing all the six tasks branchs i merged all those branches in the main branch so all the tasks files would be visible and accessible through the main branch.
---
For each task's file the task info is documented in a Markdown file including: 

1. The link for the MIA PDF file that has the full description of the task.  
2. A quick summary for the main requirments in the task.  
3. Section that shows how my work was submitted in the submission form with links refering to each problem submission.
----


> This repository makes sure that all of my tasks are preserved and accessible for future reference and
coordination.
 
> I have added an extra branch in this repo for problem 2 which contains the documentation of some basic linux commands i have used. This branch was also merged into the main branch so the main can contain evreything related to task7.
