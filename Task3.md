### In Summary:
> This task consists of 4 problems.
1. Detecting Mines: Equip the mini-tank with a photoresistor to detect
the light emitted by the mines. When light is detected, the bot will
activate a buzzer to signal the presence of a mine.
2. Defusing Mines: Implement a mechanism to defuse the bomb using a
servo motor.
3. Navigating the City: Program the tank to yaw right, yaw left, move
forward, and move backward.
4. Avoiding Obstacles: Equip the mini-tank with ultrasonic sensors to
detect and avoid obstacles such as walls and debris.

>**Bonus**:Localization: After each movement, the tank should track its location
within the city.
