### In Summary:
> Problem 1: Implement a communication system where:  
> - The master Arduino acts as the central control unit.  
> - The first slave Arduino is connected to the master using I2C.  
> - The second slave Arduino is connected to the master using serial communication.  
> - Send a message from one slave to the other relaying through the master without any direct connection between   >the two slaves.
>
>Problem 2: convert the given analog signal to a digital signal, what is the digital sequence if we use ADC with :  
>-  3-bit encoder with Sampling Time = 0.25sec,  
>-  3-bit encoder with Sampling Time = 0.5sec,  
>-  3-bit encoder with Sampling Time = 1sec,  
>-  2-bit encoder with Sampling Time = 0.25sec, at each point draw the discrete signal.

## My Work

Tinker cad was used for designig problem 1 circuit 

[Solution link for problem one](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/7U4WU2BIJ2C-task-51/editel?sharecode=DrdT7U2xOXo0JmiQM3XyuJURVwpK3cCw72sM9J08drI)

I have used python for the Analog Digital Conversion and plotting the graphs in problem 2
